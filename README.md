## Introduction
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a software application designed to detect and alert drivers when they show signs of drowsiness or fatigue while operating a vehicle. This README file provides an overview of the system, its features, and instructions for installation and usage.
## Features
1) Real-time Drowsiness Detection: The system uses computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the driver's facial features and detect signs of drowsiness in real-time.
2) Eye State Monitoring: The system tracks the driver's eye movements and monitors the eye state to detect if the eyes are closed or if the driver is blinking excessively, indicating potential drowsiness.
3) Yawning Detection: The system also identifies instances of yawning, which is a common symptom of drowsiness, by analyzing facial landmarks and mouth movements.
4) Alarm and Alert System: When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers an alarm to alert the driver. The alert can be in the form of a sound, vibration, or visual notification, depending on the implementation.
5) Adjustable Sensitivity: The system allows users to adjust the sensitivity of drowsiness detection based on their preferences or specific requirements.
6) Robust Performance: The system is designed to work in various lighting conditions and can handle different driver positions and orientations.

## Requirements:
